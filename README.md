# Justification for allocating vaccines to populations with high contact rates
Stephen Kissler (skissler@hsph.harvard.edu), Rebecca Kahn

Simulation code is in code/sim_epi.R. 

To do: 
- [ ] Fix infection probabilities (product, not sum)
- [ ] Implement prioritized vaccination (currently just random)
- [ ] Implement infection and transmission blocking 
- [ ] Implement correlation between contacts and risk (use RR defined from reference at the mean number of contacts)
